                answer: "False",
                explanation: "This is false. While an application's logic dictates calculations, the Operating System is responsible for managing memory. Applications run in a virtual address space and cannot access physical memory directly. The OS handles memory allocation and ensures that one process cannot access another's memory, providing protection and stability."

                answer: "True",
                explanation: "An interrupt vector is a table in memory that stores the memory addresses of the Interrupt Service Routines. When a device generates an interrupt, the system uses this table to find and execute the correct routine to handle it."

                explanation: "To protect the system, processes in user mode cannot access hardware directly. They must make system calls to the operating system (which runs in kernel mode) to perform hardware-related operations. This prevents user applications from interfering with system stability."

                answer: "Time-Sharing Operating Systems",
                explanation: "Operating systems can be categorized by how they are used. Batch, Time-Sharing, Network, and Real-Time are all standard classifications. 'Standalone' is a broader category, not a specific usage type in the same vein."

                answer: "Deadlock",
                explanation: "This is the classic definition of a deadlock. It's a circular dependency where two or more processes are stuck in a waiting state, each holding a resource the other needs, and thus none can proceed."

                answer: "Names containing 'a' as second char",
                explanation: "The <code>LIKE</code> operator is used for pattern matching. The underscore (<code>_</code>) is a wildcard for a single character, and the percent sign (<code>%</code>) is a wildcard for zero or more characters. Therefore, <code>'_a%'</code> matches any string where 'a' is the second character."

                answer: "The delete statement will remove all records from the table.",

                answer: "True",

                answer: "UNIONALL is faster than UNION",
                explanation: "<code>UNION</code> combines the result sets of two queries and removes duplicate rows. <code>UNION ALL</code> combines the result sets but includes all duplicate rows. Because <code>UNION ALL</code> does not perform the extra step of removing duplicates, it is generally faster."

                answer: "B and C",
                explanation: "The <code>BETWEEN</code> operator is inclusive. Therefore, it will select salaries greater than or equal to 2000 AND less than or equal to 3000. Both result sets B (2000,2500,3000) and C (2100,3000) contain values that fall within this inclusive range."

                answer: "Switch",
                explanation: "A Switch is a networking device that connects devices on a Local Area Network (LAN). It uses MAC addresses to forward data packets to the correct destination device within the same network. A router is used to connect different networks together."

                answer: "the remaining sites can continue operating",

                answer: "Re-testing is running a test again; regression testing looks for unexpected side effects",
                explanation: "Re-testing is done after a defect has been fixed to ensure the original defect is gone. Regression Testing is done after a change to ensure that the change has not introduced new bugs in previously working code."

                answer: "As soon as possible in the development life cycle",
                explanation: "Modern software development methodologies emphasize starting testing activities as early as possible ('shifting left'). Finding and fixing defects is much cheaper and easier in the early stages than after the code has been written."

                answer: "Poor software and poor testing",
