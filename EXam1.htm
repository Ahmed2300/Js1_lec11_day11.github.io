                answer: "True",
                explanation: "Main memory, also known as primary memory, is the computer's primary storage. It includes both RAM, which is volatile and used for active data and machine code, and ROM, which is non-volatile and holds firmware or software instructions that are rarely changed."

                answer: "False",
                explanation: "Secondary storage devices, like hard drives and SSDs, are used for both input and output operations. You can read data from them (input) and write data to them (output) for permanent storage. They are not solely output devices."

                question: "Bootstrap is a framework stored in ROM contains some instructions called basic input output instructions (BIOS).",
                options: ["True", "False"],
                answer: "True",
                explanation: "The bootstrap program, often part of the BIOS or UEFI firmware, is stored in ROM. It initializes the computer hardware and starts the process of loading the operating system when the computer is turned on."

                question: "Windows server 2008 and Novell Netware are batching operating systems.",
                options: ["True", "False"],
                answer: "False",
                explanation: "Windows Server 2008 and Novell NetWare are network operating systems, designed to support servers, and they handle multiple user requests interactively. Batch operating systems process jobs in groups without direct user interaction."
            },
            {

                options: ["True", "False"],
                answer: "True",
                explanation: "A primary role of an operating system is to provide an abstraction layer. This hides the complex details of the hardware from the user and applications, making the computer easier to use and program."
            },
            {
                question: "The application itself is responsible for accessing the memory variable storage and performing calculations based on values in memory.",
                options: ["True", "False"],
                answer: "False",
                explanation: "This is false. While an application's logic dictates calculations, the Operating System is responsible for managing memory. Applications run in a virtual address space and cannot access physical memory directly. The OS handles memory allocation and ensures that one process cannot access another's memory, providing protection and stability."

                answer: "True",
                explanation: "An interrupt vector is a table in memory that stores the memory addresses of the Interrupt Service Routines. When a device generates an interrupt, the system uses this table to find and execute the correct routine to handle it."

                answer: "False",
                explanation: "To protect the system, processes in user mode cannot access hardware directly. They must make system calls to the operating system (which runs in kernel mode) to perform hardware-related operations. This prevents user applications from interfering with system stability."

                answer: "Efficiency and responsiveness",
                explanation: "The primary goals of an OS are to be efficient (perform well), convenient (easy to use), and able to evolve (abstract and extend). While an OS is involved in networking, controlling network data flow is not its primary objective compared to core functions like efficiency."

                answer: "Time-Sharing Operating Systems",
                explanation: "Operating systems can be categorized by how they are used. Batch, Time-Sharing, Network, and Real-Time are all standard classifications. 'Standalone' is a broader category, not a specific usage type in the same vein."

                answer: "Deadlock",
                explanation: "This is the classic definition of a deadlock. It's a circular dependency where two or more processes are stuck in a waiting state, each holding a resource the other needs, and thus none can proceed."

                answer: "Switch",
                explanation: "A Switch is a networking device that connects devices on a Local Area Network (LAN). It uses MAC addresses to forward data packets to the correct destination device within the same network. A router is used to connect different networks together."

                answer: "As soon as possible in the development life cycle",
